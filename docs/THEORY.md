# Theory Assumptions & Limitations
- **Ψ**: Measures energy deviation as proxy for "internal friction" leading to egoism.
- **Ω**: Multiplicative risk score – assumes interactions amplify dangers.
- **Limitations** (per Kimi's review):
  - No empirical data.
  - Formulas are conceptual; needs validation.
  - Assumes access to energy logs (not always available).
